          My passion for computing wasn&apos;t sparked in a single moment;
          it&apos;s been a <b>constant throughout my life</b>. From my earliest
          memories, I&apos;ve been drawn to technology, starting with video
          games. This curiosity soon expanded to <b>hardware</b>, where I began
          exploring the insides of computers. Gradually, my fascination led me
          to the world of <b>coding</b>, where I started to unravel the magic
          behind the machines.

          My main sources of inspiration boil down to two icons from different

          that <b>no dream is too big</b> if you&apos;re willing to work for it.
          Ronaldo, on the other hand, embodies the spirit of{" "}

          determination lead to unmatched success.
